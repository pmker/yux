 * CKEditor Plugin : How to install?
 */

Installing this editor is remarkably simple

+ Download the CKEditor distribution (actually tested on 3.1) here :
  http://ckeditor.com/download
+ Extract the "ckeditor" folder directly inside this plugin folder. 
  (Thus you should find ajxpInstall/plugins/editor.ckeditor/ckeditor/[CKEDITOR FILES])
+ Rename the manifest.xml.default to manifest.xml
+ Reload Pydio, you're done! If you select an HTML file, you should now be able to
  "Open with..." the file with this HTML Editor!
  
Enjoy.
