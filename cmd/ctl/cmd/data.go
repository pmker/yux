Data are indexed in the various data sources you may have defined, and aggregated into a unique tree by
the tree service. This command allows you to CRUD either directly the index of a given datasource, or query
directly the aggregated tree. By default, it queries the tree (service is pydio.grpc.data.tree), to query a datasource
directly, use --source=datasourcename (will point to service pydio.grpc.data.index.datasourcename)
In the first case (tree), folders paths are always prefixed with the datasource name. In the second case (datasource),
paths is the real path in the datasource.

See 'data list --help' for examples.
