### Examples

Delete the port entry for the micro.web service (rest api)
$ ` + os.Args[0] + ` config delete micro.web port

`,
	Args: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
		if len(args) != 2 {
			return errors.New("requires two arguments")
		}

		// IsValidService ?
		return nil
	},
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		id := args[0]
		path := args[1]

		config.Del("services", id, path)

		err := config.Save("cli", fmt.Sprintf("Delete by path %s/%s", id, path))
		if err != nil {
			cmd.Println(err)
			return
		}

		cmd.Println("Deleted")
